A machine learning-based model to classify emails as spam or not spam using NLP and classification algorithms.

# üìß Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning project to classify emails as **spam** or **not spam** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms. This project demonstrates how textual data can be converted into numerical form and used to build an effective predictive model.
